I am pursuing a Ph.D. in applied mathematics at the [University of Toulouse](https://en.univ-toulouse.fr/). My work as a junior researcher at the [Toulouse Mathematics Institute](https://math.univ-toulouse.fr/en/) involves developing new multiobjective optimization techniques and applying them to the study and solution of problems of sequential decision making under uncertainty. I have been teaching mathematics to undergraduates at the College of Science and Engineering since 2022.

I am, by training, an industrial and systems engineer: I received my M.Sc.Eng. from [INP](https://www.inp-toulouse.fr/en/index.html) in 2022. Born and raised in Morocco, I have resided in France for almost five years now.
