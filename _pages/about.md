I'm pursuing a PhD in applied mathematics at the [University of Toulouse](https://en.univ-toulouse.fr/). My work as a junior researcher at the [Toulouse Mathematics Institute](https://math.univ-toulouse.fr/en/) involves developing new multiobjective optimization techniques and applying them to the study and solution of problems of sequential decision making under uncertainty. I've been teaching undergraduate mathematics at my university's College of Science and Engineering since 2022.
