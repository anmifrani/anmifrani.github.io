# Welcome!
<b>Anas Mifrani</b> <br>
<b>Ph.D. Candidate</b> <br>
<b>Department of Mathematics</b> <br>
<b>College of Science and Engineering, University of Toulouse</b> <br>

I'm pursuing a Ph.D. in applied mathematics at the [University of Toulouse](https://en.univ-toulouse.fr/). My work as a junior researcher at the [Toulouse Mathematics Institute](https://math.univ-toulouse.fr/en/) involves developing new multiobjective optimization techniques and applying them to the study and solution of problems of sequential decision making under uncertainty. I've been teaching mathematics to undergraduates at the College of Science and Engineering since 2022.

I was trained as an industrial and systems engineer at [INP](https://www.inp-toulouse.fr/en/index.html), from which I received my M.Sc.Eng. in 2022. Born and raised in Morocco, I've resided in France for almost five years now.
