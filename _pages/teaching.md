* <b>Pre-Medical School Mathematics</b>: Since the academic year 2022/2023, I've been teaching at the College of Science & Engineering a full introductory course on probability theory, real analysis and single variable calculus to undergraduates on a selective pre-medical track. 

* <b>Logic & Set Theory</b>: During the second half of 2022/2023, I gave Bachelor-level tutorials on formal logic and set theory to mathematics, physics and computer science majors. The material for these sessions was based on lectures prepared by Professor [Dominikus Noll](https://www.math.univ-toulouse.fr/~noll/).

* <b>Calculus I</b>: I was appointed a teaching assistant for an introductory course on calculus during the first half of 2022/2023. My students comprised mathematics and computer science majors.
